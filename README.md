This is an old build of discontinued [haXe pathfinder](https://lib.haxe.org/p/polygonal-ai/1.0.0/files/de/polygonal/ai/pathfinding/) by Michael Baczynski. Although it uses [Data Structures lib](https://github.com/polygonal/ds), much of ds.* API that was not used in pathfinder code isn't available in this build.

## Install

Get it via NPM
```
npm install polygonal-pathfinding
```

or GIT

git clone https://github.com/makc/polygonal-pathfinding.git
